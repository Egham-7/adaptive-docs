## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Provider Not Appearing" icon="eye-slash">
- Check `opencode.json` syntax is valid JSON
- Ensure provider ID "adaptive" matches between auth and config
- Run `opencode auth list` to confirm credentials were added
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Authentication Errors" icon="key">
- Regenerate API key from [Adaptive dashboard](https://www.llmadaptive.uk/dashboard)
- Verify provider ID matches exactly between auth and config
- Try re-running `opencode auth login` and selecting "Other"
