Kilo Code is a powerful VS Code plugin with support for MCP (Model Context Protocol), enabling you to generate code, debug, and manage projects directly within the editor â€” delivering a more efficient and intelligent development experience. Kilo Code's performance is further enhanced with Adaptive's intelligent routing, helping you achieve 60-90% cost savings while maintaining the same AI-assisted development experience.

<Tip>
**Save 60-90% on AI development costs** with intelligent model routing. Works seamlessly with Kilo Code's development features.
</Tip>

## Get Your Adaptive API Key

Visit [www.llmadaptive.uk/sign-up?redirect_url=/api-platform/orgs](https://www.llmadaptive.uk/sign-up?redirect_url=/api-platform/orgs) to create an account and generate your API key.

## Step 1: Installing the Kilo Code Plugin

### 1. Open the Extensions Marketplace
a. Launch VS Code
b. Click the Extensions Marketplace icon on the left sidebar
c. Search for "Kilo Code" in the search bar
d. Locate the Kilo Code plugin

### 2. Install the Plugin
a. Click the **Install** button to begin installation
b. After installation, choose to trust the developer if prompted

## Step 2: Configuring API Settings

### 1. Select API Key Authentication
Choose "Use your own API key" when prompted by Kilo Code

### 2. Enter Configuration Details
Fill in the following information as specified:

- **API Provider**: Select "OpenAI Compatible"
- **OpenAI Base URL**: Enter `https://api.llmadaptive.uk/v1`
- **API Key**: Input your Adaptive API Key
- **Model Name**: Enter your preferred model (e.g., `gpt-4o`, `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022`) and select "Use Custom"

## Step 3: Configuring MCP (Optional)

### 1. Add an MCP Server
Kilo Code supports MCP (Model Context Protocol) to extend the capabilities of AI models. You can add MCP servers to enhance functionality. Example MCP server configurations:

```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "filesystem": {
            "command": "npx",
            "args": [
                "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem",
                "/path/to/your/project"
            ]
        },
        "sqlite": {
            "command": "uv",
            "args": [
                "--directory",
                "path/to/sqlite/server",
                "run",
                "mcp-server-sqlite",
                "--db-path",
                "~/database.db"
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

## Step 4: Getting Started

Once configured, you can enter prompts in the input box to leverage the AI model for various tasks, such as:

- Code generation and refactoring
- Debugging and error analysis
- Project analysis and documentation writing
- Database query optimization (with MCP)
- File system operations (with MCP)

## Alternative Setup Methods

<CodeGroup>
```bash Environment Variables
export OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://api.llmadaptive.uk/v1
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-adaptive-api-key
# Then launch Kilo Code from terminal
```

```json Configuration File
// In kilo-code settings.json
{
  "kiloCode": {
    "apiProvider": "openai-compatible",
    "baseUrl": "https://api.llmadaptive.uk/v1",
    "apiKey": "your-adaptive-api-key",
    "model": "gpt-4o"
  }
}
```

```text Manual Configuration
1. Open VS Code settings (Ctrl/Cmd + ,)
2. Search for "Kilo Code"
3. Set API Provider to "OpenAI Compatible"
4. Enter Base URL: https://api.llmadaptive.uk/v1
5. Enter your Adaptive API key
6. Select your preferred model
```
