Adaptive's zero completion insurance automatically protects you from being charged for failed requests or responses with no output tokens. When responses are empty or encounter errors, you pay nothing - even if underlying providers charge for processing.

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Request Monitoring">
    Every response is automatically analyzed for completion tokens and status
  </Step>
  <Step title="Failure Detection">
    Identifies responses with zero output tokens and blank or error finish reasons
  </Step>
  <Step title="Automatic Protection">
    Credits are not deducted from your account when protection criteria are met
  </Step>
  <Step title="Cost Absorption">
    Adaptive absorbs provider costs for protected requests at no charge to you
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Protection Criteria

Zero completion insurance automatically applies when responses meet **either** of these conditions:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Zero Output + Blank Finish" icon="circle-xmark">
    **Response has zero completion tokens** AND **finish reason is blank/null**
    
    Common scenarios: Provider timeouts, processing errors, system failures
  </Card>
  <Card title="Error Finish Reason" icon="exclamation-triangle">
    **Response has an error finish reason** regardless of token count
    
    Common scenarios: Content policy violations, rate limits, service unavailable
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Real Examples

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Provider Timeout">
**Request**: "Write a detailed analysis of quantum computing"  
**Response**: Empty (provider timeout)  
**Finish Reason**: null  
**Your Cost**: **$0.00** (protected)  
**Without Insurance**: $0.12 for prompt processing
</Tab>

<Tab title="Rate Limit Hit">
**Request**: "Hello, how are you?"  
**Response**: Error message  
**Finish Reason**: "rate_limit_exceeded"  
**Your Cost**: **$0.00** (protected)  
**Without Insurance**: $0.05 for prompt processing
</Tab>

<Tab title="Content Filter">
**Request**: Inappropriate content request  
**Response**: "Content blocked by safety filters"  
**Finish Reason**: "content_filter"  
**Your Cost**: **$0.00** (protected)  
**Without Insurance**: $0.08 for prompt processing
</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Coverage Examples

### Protected Scenarios

These response types are automatically covered at no cost:

<CodeGroup>
```json Empty Response
{
  "id": "chatcmpl-abc123",
  "choices": [{
    "message": {"content": ""},
    "finish_reason": null
  }],
  "usage": {
    "prompt_tokens": 15,
    "completion_tokens": 0,  // Zero output tokens
    "total_tokens": 15
  }
}
// Cost: $0.00 (protected)
```

```json Error Response
{
  "id": "chatcmpl-def456", 
  "choices": [{
    "message": {"content": "Request failed due to rate limiting"},
    "finish_reason": "rate_limit_exceeded"  // Error finish reason
  }],
  "usage": {
    "prompt_tokens": 8,
    "completion_tokens": 7,
    "total_tokens": 15
  }
}
// Cost: $0.00 (protected)
```
</CodeGroup>

### Normal Billing

These responses are billed normally as they contain successful completions:

<CodeGroup>
```json Successful Response
{
  "id": "chatcmpl-ghi789",
  "choices": [{
    "message": {"content": "Hello! How can I help you today?"},
    "finish_reason": "stop"  // Normal completion
  }],
  "usage": {
    "prompt_tokens": 9,
    "completion_tokens": 12,  // Has output tokens
    "total_tokens": 21
  }
}
// Cost: Normal billing applies
```

```json Partial Response
{
  "id": "chatcmpl-jkl012",
  "choices": [{
    "message": {"content": "This response was cut off due to"},
    "finish_reason": "length"  // Length limit, but has content
  }],
  "usage": {
    "prompt_tokens": 20,
    "completion_tokens": 8,   // Has output tokens
    "total_tokens": 28
  }
}
// Cost: Normal billing applies
```
</CodeGroup>

## Viewing Protected Requests

### Dashboard Activity

In your [Adaptive dashboard](https://www.llmadaptive.uk/dashboard), protected requests are clearly marked:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Zero Cost Display" icon="eye">
    **Credit Deduction**: Shows $0.00 for protected requests
  </Card>
  <Card title="Protection Badge" icon="shield">
    **Visual Indicator**: Protected requests display insurance badge
  </Card>
  <Card title="Reason Details" icon="info">
    **Protection Reason**: Shows why request was protected (error type, empty response)
  </Card>
  <Card title="Provider Costs" icon="chart-bar">
    **Transparency**: View actual provider charges that were absorbed
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Response Metadata

Protected requests include additional metadata in the response:

```json
{
  "id": "chatcmpl-protected",
  "choices": [{"message": {"content": ""}}],
  "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 12, "completion_tokens": 0},
  "insurance": {
    "protected": true,           // Request was protected
    "reason": "zero_completion", // Why it was protected
    "original_cost": 0.08,       // What you would have paid
    "savings": 0.08              // Amount saved
  }
}
```

## Comparison with Other Providers

<Note>
Most LLM providers charge for prompt processing regardless of response success. Adaptive is unique in providing comprehensive zero completion insurance.

## FAQ

<Accordion title="Does insurance affect my API usage limits?">
No, zero completion insurance does not count against your API rate limits or quotas. Protected requests are tracked separately and do not impact your usage calculations.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What happens during provider outages?">
During widespread provider outages, all requests that fail due to service unavailability are automatically protected. You won't be charged for any requests during outage periods, regardless of duration.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I disable zero completion insurance?">
No, insurance cannot be disabled as it only benefits users by preventing unwanted charges. There are no downsides to having this protection always active.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How quickly is protection applied?">
Protection is applied instantly when responses are received. Credit deductions are prevented in real-time, so you never see charges that are later refunded.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Does this work with custom models?">
Yes, zero completion insurance works with all models and providers available through Adaptive, including custom fine-tuned models and enterprise provider configurations.
</Accordion>

## Implementation

Zero completion insurance requires no code changes - it works automatically with your existing integrations:

<CodeGroup>
```javascript JavaScript/Node.js
// Normal request - insurance automatically active
const completion = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: "gpt-4",
  messages: [{ role: "user", content: "Hello!" }]
});

// Check if request was protected
if (completion.insurance?.protected) {
  console.log(`Saved $${completion.insurance.savings} on failed request`);
}
```

```python Python
# Normal request - insurance automatically active
completion = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
)

# Check if request was protected
if hasattr(completion, 'insurance') and completion.insurance.get('protected'):
    print(f"Saved ${completion.insurance['savings']} on failed request")
```

```bash cURL
# Normal request - insurance automatically active
curl https://www.llmadaptive.uk/api/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-adaptive-key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-4",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
  }'
