Bring Your Own Keys (BYOK) allows you to connect your own API keys from providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and others to Adaptive. This gives you maximum cost savings while still benefiting from Adaptive's intelligent routing, caching, and reliability features.

## How BYOK Works

When you provide your own provider API keys, Adaptive uses them to make requests on your behalf instead of using our pooled API keys. This means:

  <Card title="Pay Only Overhead" icon="dollar-sign">
    You only pay Adaptive's overhead fee ($0.10/1M input + $0.20/1M output), not the underlying model costs. Your provider bills you directly.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Full Routing Control" icon="brain">
    Continue to benefit from intelligent routing, semantic caching, fallback mechanisms, and all other Adaptive features.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Enhanced Privacy" icon="shield">
    Your API requests go through your own provider accounts, giving you complete control and isolation.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Usage Tracking" icon="chart-line">
    Track usage across both Adaptive's dashboard and your provider dashboards for comprehensive visibility.

## Pricing with BYOK

When using your own API keys, you only pay Adaptive's overhead:
- **Input tokens**: $0.10 per 1M tokens
- **Output tokens**: $0.20 per 1M tokens
- **Semantic cache hits**: 50% off
- **Prompt cache hits**: Free

**You do NOT pay Adaptive for the underlying model costs** - those are billed directly by your provider.

### Cost Example
A request with 100K input + 50K output tokens:
- **Without BYOK**: ~$5.02 total (model costs + $0.02 overhead)
- **With BYOK**: $0.02 overhead (model costs billed directly by provider)

## Benefits of BYOK

### Maximum Cost Savings
Save significantly on high-volume workloads by paying only the overhead fee to Adaptive.

### Complete Control

- Separate environments for dev/staging/production
- Meet specific compliance requirements

### Privacy and Data Governance
- Requests authenticated with your own credentials
- No request pooling with other users
- Direct audit trail with your provider
- Easier compliance with data residency requirements

## Security and Best Practices

<Warning>
Never share your API keys or commit them to version control. Adaptive stores your keys encrypted at rest and in transit.
</Warning>

Best practices:
- Rotate keys regularly
- Use separate keys for dev/staging/production
- Monitor key usage in both Adaptive and provider dashboards
- Set spending limits at the provider level
- Revoke unused or compromised keys immediately

## Routing with Custom Keys

Even with BYOK enabled, Adaptive's intelligent routing continues to work:

1. **Model Selection**: Adaptive analyzes your request complexity
2. **Provider Selection**: Routes to the optimal provider based on your available custom keys, model capabilities, and cost optimization
3. **Fallback**: If your custom key fails or hits quota, Adaptive can fall back to other configured keys or pooled keys

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Do I need custom keys for all providers?">
    No, you can mix and match. Use custom keys for some providers and let Adaptive use its pooled keys for others.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens if my custom key reaches its quota?">
    Adaptive can automatically fall back to other configured keys or its own pooled keys, depending on your fallback configuration.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I see which key was used for each request?">
    Yes, Adaptive's dashboard shows detailed request logs including which provider and which key (yours vs pooled) was used.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is BYOK available on all plans?">
    BYOK is available on Team and Enterprise plans. Developer plan users can upgrade to access this feature.
